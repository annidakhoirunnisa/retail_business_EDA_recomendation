# Background
## Role
As a consultant for WOMart, which already has purchase data, we will use this data to enhance the company's performance by analyzing it, generating new insights, and creating predictive sales models for each store to improve and manage cash flow.

## Problem Statement
WOMart is a leading retail chain in the field of nutrition and supplements, offering a comprehensive range of products for all health and fitness needs. WOMart has over 350 retail stores spread across more than 100 cities. Sales at WOMart can fluctuate due to seasonal variations, regional differences, and product demand fluctuations. Additionally, external factors such as economic conditions, new health trends, and competitor actions can also impact sales. Therefore, accurate sales forecasting is crucial to ensure adequate inventory, optimal staffing, and efficient financial planning. How can sales be increased?

## Goals

# Insights
## Average Sales During Holidays and Discount periods

The analysis uncovered two key insights: higher discount levels are positively correlated with increased sales, and holiday periods significantly boost average sales compared to non-holiday times.

## Monthly Sales Trend

Sales trends over an 18-month period show strong peaks in January, May, and December, likely driven by seasonal factors or marketing efforts. Meanwhile, February and November see significant sales declines, indicating seasonal slowdowns. These trends suggest the importance of adjusting sales and marketing strategies to align with these cycles for better performance.

## Weekly Sales Trend

The analysis of weekly sales trends reveals a notable rise in sales during the 3rd and 4th weeks of most months, especially in April, August, and December. However, February shows steady sales throughout. This pattern suggests that financial factors, such as end-of-month paydays, may drive increased spending in the later weeks of the month.

## Average Sales by Regional, Location, and Store Type

The highest average sales are found in Region R1, Location L2, and Store Type S4.

The data suggests a negative correlation between average order value and average sales, where stores with lower average order values tend to have higher sales volume, potentially due to offering more affordable products, while stores with higher order values may cater to niche or premium markets with fewer but higher-value transactions.

The average sales rankings from highest to lowest are R1, R3, R2, and R4, aligning with the presence of S4 and S3 stores. Regions with more S4 and S3 stores tend to have higher average sales.

The visualization shows that Store Types 3 and 4 are missing in some locations, while Store Type S1, despite having a high store count, has low performance metrics. Store Type S2 is present everywhere except L2 but has the lowest average sales.

# Business Recommendation
1.  **High Performing Store Expansion:**  To boost overall sales, expand Store Type 4 (S4) into locations L3, L4, and L5 across all regions, as it has shown high average sales performance. Additionally, introduce Store Type 3 (S3) to locations L3, L4, and L5 in Regions R2 and R4, and to locations L4 and L5 in Regions R1 and R3. This targeted expansion leverages the success of these high-performing store types to enhance sales potential in these locations and regions.
    
2.  **Low Performing Store Evaluation**: Evaluate Store Type S1 for potential reduction or optimization, and consider strategies to improve the performance of Store Type S2, especially in locations where it is present.
    
3.  **Sales Strategy Based on Monthly Trends:**  Since sales tend to increase at the end of the month, especially around payday weekends, the business should adjust its sales strategy to capitalize on this trend. This could involve scheduling promotions or special offers during these times to encourage higher purchases.
    
4.  **Leverage Peak Sales Periods:**  Knowing that sales peak in January, May, July, and December, the business should prepare with adequate stock and effective marketing strategies to maximize profits during these periods.
    
5.  **Use Discounts to Boost Average Sales:**  Insights indicate that discounts tend to increase average sales. Therefore, the business should consider adopting a more aggressive discount strategy to enhance sales.
